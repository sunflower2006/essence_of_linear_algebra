### Vectors, what even are they?

```
The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector.
线性代数中最基础、最根源的组成部分就是向量。

So it's worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.
所以我得确信我们在“向量究竟是什么”这一问题上达成共识。

You see, broadly speaking, there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors,
一般来说，有三种看待向量的观点，看似不同却有所关联，

which I'll call the physics student perspective,
我分别将它们成为物理专业学生的视角，

the computer science student perspective,
计算机专业学生的视角

and the mathematician's perspective.
以及数学家的视角

The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.
从物理专业学生的视角看，向量是空间中的箭头。

What defines a given vector is its length, and the direction it's pointing.
决定一个向量的是它的长度和它所指的方向。

But as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around and it's still the same vector.
但是只要以上两个特征相同，你可以自由移动一个向量而保持它不变。

Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional,
处在平面中的向量是二维的，

and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.
而处在我们所生活的空间中的向量是三维的。

The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.
从计算机专业学生的视角看，向量是有序的数字列表。

For example, let's say that you were doing some analytics about house prices,
比如说你正在做一些有关房价的分析，

and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.
而你只关心两个特征：房屋面积和价格

You might model each house with a pair of numbers:
你可能会用一对数字对每个房屋进行建模：

the first indicating square footage, and the second indicating price.
第一个数表示房屋面积，第二个数代表价格。

Notice the order matters here.
注意，这里的数字顺序不可颠倒。

In the lingo, you'd modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors,
用行话来讲，你会用二维向量对房屋进行建模，

where in the context, "vector" is pretty much just a fancy word for "list",
在这里，“向量”只不过是“列表”的一个花哨说法，

and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is 2.
之所以这个向量是二维的，是因为这个列表的长度是 2。

The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both of these views,
另一方面，数学家试图去概括这两种观点，

basically saying that a vector can be anything.
大致地说，向量可以是任何东西。

where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number.
只要保证两个向量相加以及数字与向量相乘是有意义的即可。

operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.
我会在这个视频后半段讨论这两种运算。

The details of this view are rather abstract,
这种看待向量的观点相当抽象，

and I actually think it's healthy to ignore it until the last video of this series,
我想，把它放到这个系列的最后再说，

favoring a more concrete setting in the interim.
在此期间穿插一些更加具象的内容，这也并无大碍。

But the reason that I bring it up here is that it hints at the fact that
但是我在这里提到了这个观点，因为它暗示了一个事实

the ideas of vector addition and multiplication by numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.
即向量加法和向量数乘贯穿线性代数始终，二者起着很重要的作用。

But before I talk about these operations,
在我讨论这两个运算之前，

let's just settle in on a specific thought to have in mind when I say the word "vector".
我们先来确定一种思考“向量”的特定方式。

Think of some vector...
现在想象一些变量

Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here,
因为我现在关注的是它的几何方面，

whenever I introduce a new topic involving vectors,
所以每当我引入一个关于向量的新主题时，

I want you to first think about an arrow.
我需要你首先考虑一个箭头。

And specifically, think about that arrow inside a coordinate system, like the x-y plane,
更具体地说，考虑这个箭头落在某个坐标系中，比如 x-y 平面，

with its tail sitting at the origin.
并且箭头起点位于原点。

This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective,
这与物理专业学生的看法略有不同，

where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.
因为在他们眼中，向量可以在空间中自由落脚。

In linear algebra, it's almost always the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin.
但是在线性代数中，向量经常以原点作为起点。

Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of "arrow in space",
一旦你理解了“向量是空间中的箭头”这种观点，

we'll translate it over to the "list of numbers" point of view.
我们就来看看“向量是有序的数字列表”这种观点。

which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.
我们可以通过向量坐标来理解它。

Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system.
我很清楚，你们当中的大部分都已经很熟悉坐标系这个概念了。

it's worth waling through explicitly,
但是这也值得再详细叙述一遍，

since this is where all of the important back-and-forth happens between the two perspectives of linear algebar.
因为这两种观点之间的碰撞，恰恰形成了线性代数中的重要概念。

Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment.
现在我们先把眼光局限在二维空间中。

you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis,
画一条水平的线，我们叫它 x 轴，

and a vertical line, called the y-axis.
再画一条竖直的线，我们叫它 y 轴。

The place where they intersect is called the origin,
两个轴的交点我们称之为原点，

which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.
你应该把它看作整个空间的中心和所有向量的根源。

After choosing an arbitrary length to represent 1, you make tick marks on each axis to represent this distance.
选取一个任意的长度代表1，你就可以在坐标轴上标记刻度线来代表这一距离。

When I want to convey the idea of 2-D space as a whole, which you'll see comes up a lot in these videos,
接下来的视频中你会看到，当我想用它表达整个二维空间时，

I'll extend these tick marks to make grid lines.
我会把这些刻度线延长成为网格线。

but right now they'll actually get a little bit in the way.
但是它们现在有点碍事，所以先不画了。

The coordinates of a vector is pair of number.
一个向量的坐标由一对数构成。

that basically give instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector, at the origin, to its tip.
这对数指导你如何从原点（向量起点）出发到达它的尖端（向量终点），

The first number tells you how far to walk along with x-axis,
第一个数告诉你沿着 x 轴走多远，

positive numbers indicating rightward motion, negative numbers indicating leftward motion.
正数代表向右移动，负数代表向左移动。

And the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis after that,
第二个数告诉你在此之后沿着平行 y 轴的方向走多远，

positive numbers indicating upward motion, and negative numbers indicating downward motion.
正数代表向上移动，负数代表向下移动。

To distinguish vectors from point,
为了把向量和点区别开，

the convention is to write this pair of numbers vertically with square brackets around them.
惯用的方法是把这对数竖着写，然后用方括号括起来。

Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector,
每一对数给出唯一一个向量，

and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.
而每一个向量恰好对应唯一一对数。

What about in three dimensions?
三维空间的向量又如何呢？

Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis, which is perpendicular to both the x- and y-axes,
那我们就再添加垂直于 x 轴和 y 轴的第三根轴，叫它 z 轴，

and in this case each vector is associated with an ordered triplet of numbers:
这种情况下，每个向量就与一个有序三原数组对应：

the first tells you how far to move along the x-axis,
第一个数告诉你沿着 x 轴走多远，

the second tells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis,
第二个数告诉你沿着平行 y 轴的方向走多远，

and the third one tells you how far to then move parallel to this new z-axis.
第三个数告诉你沿着平行 z 轴的方向走多远。

Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space,
每一个三元数组给出唯一一个向量，

and every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.
而每一个向量恰好对应唯一一个三元数组。

Alright, so back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers.
现在我们回到向量加法和向量数乘。

After all, every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.
毕竟线性代数中每一个主题都围绕着这两种运算。

Luckily, each one is pretty straightforward to define.
很幸运，两个运算的定义都很直接。

Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing up and a little to the right,
假设这里有两个向量，一个指向上方，略微偏右，

and the other one pointing right and down a bit.
另一个指向右方，略微偏下。

To add these two vectors, move the second one so that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.
为了把它们相加，我们平移第二个向量，使它的起点与第一个向量的终点重合。

Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to where the tip of the second one now sits,
然后画一个向量，它从第一个向量的起点出发，指向第二个向量的终点，

that new vector is their sum.
这个向量就是它们的和。

This definition of addition, by the way, is pretty much the only time in linear algebra where we let vectors stray away from the origin.
顺便一提，这个向量加法的定义差不多是线性代数中唯一允许向量离开原点的情形。

Now why is this a reasonalbe thing to do?
那为什么这样定义是合理的？

Why this definition of addition and not some other one?
为什么不用其他的方法去定义呢？

Well, the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement,
这里，我比较喜欢把每个向量看作一种特定的运动，

a step with a certain distance and direction in space.
即在空间中朝着某个方向迈出一定距离。

If you take a step along the first vector,
如果你沿着第一个向量运动

then take a step in the direction and distance described by the second vector,
然后再按照第二个向量所描述的运动方式运动，

the overall effect is just the same as if you moved along the sum of those two vectors to start with.
总体效果与你沿着这两个向量的和运动无异。

You could think about this as an extension of how we think about adding numbers on a number line.
你也可以把它看做数轴上加法的一种扩展。

One way that we teach kids to think about this, say with 2+5,
我们可以用这种方法教小孩做加法，比如 2+5，

is to think of moving 2 steps to the right, followed by another 5 steps to the right.
考虑向右移动 2 步，再向右移动 5 步。

The overall effect is the same as if you just took 7 steps to the right.
总体效果与向右移动 7 步无异。

In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically.
现在我们从数字的角度看看向量加法。

The first vector here has coordinates (1, 2), and the second one has coordinates (3, -1).
第一个向量的坐标是 (1, 2)，第二个向量的坐标是 (3, -1)。

When you take the vector sum using this tip-to-tail method,
当你用向量首尾连接的方法加和向量时，

you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second vector -
你可以把它看做一个从原点出发，到第二个向量终点的四步运动 -

walk 1 to the right, then 2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down.
向右 1 步，向上 2 步，向右 3 步，最后向下 1 步。

Reorganising these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion, then do all of the vertical motion,
我们重新编排它们的顺序，使得我们先完成所有水平运动，再完成所有竖直运动，

you can read it as saying, first move (1+3) to the right then move (2-1) up,
你可以看出来，首先向右 (1+3) 步，然后向上 (2-1) 步，

so the new vector has coordinates (1+3, 2+(-1)).
所以新向量的坐标就是 (1+3, 2+(-1))。

In general, vector addition in this "list of numbers" conception looks like matching up their terms, and adding each one together.
总的来说，在“向量是有序的数字列表”观点里，向量加法就是把对应项相加。

The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.
另一个向量基础运算就是向量数乘。

Now this is best understood just by looking at a few examples.
我们先看几个例子来更好理解这个概念。

If you take the number 2, and multiply it by a given vector,
比如说你选择数字 2，把它与一个给定向量相乘，

it means you stretch out that vector so that it's 2 times as long as then you started.
意味着你把这个向量拉长为原向量的 2 倍。

If you multiply that vector by, say, 1/3, it means you squish it down so that it's 1/3 of the original length.
再比如，如果将向量乘以 1/3，就意味着这个向量长度缩短为原来的 1/3。

When you multiply it by a negative number, like -1.8,
当向量与一个负数相乘时，比如 -1.8，

then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.
说明这个向量首先反向，然后伸长为原来的 1.8 倍。

This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of a vector is called "scaling",
这种拉伸或压缩，有时又使向量反向的过程被称为“缩放”，

and whenever you catch a number like 2 or 1/3 or -1.8 acting like this,
而我们选择的 2、1/3、-1.8 或者其他任何数，

scaling some vector, you call it a "scalar".
它们用于缩放向量，被称为“标量”。

In fact, throughout linear algebar, one of the main things that numbers do is scale vectors,
实际上自始至终，数字在线性代数中起到的主要作用就是缩放向量，

so it's common to use the word "scalar" pretty much interchangeably with the word "number".
所以“标量”和“数字”两个词通常在这里可以相互替换。

Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of, say, 2,
从数字的角度来看，将一个向量伸长为原来的 2 倍，

corresponds to multiplying each of its components by that factor 2.
对应于将每一个分量分别乘以 2。

So in the conception of vectors as lists of numbers,
所以将向量看作一个数字列表时，

multiplying a given vector by a scalar means multiplying each one of those components by that scalar.
向量与标量相乘就是将向量中的每个分量与标量相乘。

You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say that linear algebra topics tend to revolve around these two fundamental operations: vector addition, and scalar multiplication.
在接下来的视频中，你就会明白我之前所说的“线性代数围绕两种基本运算：向量加法和向量乘法”究竟是什么意思了。

And I'll talk more in the last video about how and why the mathematician thinks only about these operations,
我也会在最后一期视频中更详细地讨论为什么数学家只考虑这两种运算，

independent and abstracted away from however you choose to represent vectors.
并且又是如何将它们抽象独立出来，不管你选择什么代表向量都与之无关。

In truth, it doesn't matter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally being arrows in space,
实际上无论你怎么看待向量都无所谓，或把向量看做空间中的箭头，

like I'm suggesting you do, that happen to have a nice numerical representation,
就像我建议你做的，这种观点恰好有漂亮的数值表示与之对应，

or fundamental as lists of numbers that happen to have a nice geometric interpretation.
或把向量看做数字列表，这种观点又恰好有漂亮的几何意义与之对应。

The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do with either one of these views that it does with the ability to translate back and forth between them.
线性代数的效用很少体现在这些观点的其中一个上，而是更多地体现在它能够在这些观点中互相转化。

It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualize many lists of numbers in a visual way,
线性代数为数据分析提供了一条将大量数据列表概念化、可视化的渠道，

which can seriously clarify patterns in data, and give a global view of what certain operations do.
它让数据样式变得非常明晰，并让你大致了解特定运算的意义。

And on the flip side, it gives people like physicists and computer graphics programmers a language to describe space and the manipulation of space using numbers that can be crunched and run through a computer.
另一方面，线性代数给物理学家和计算机图形程序员提供了一种语言，让他们通过计算机能处理的数字来描述病操纵空间。

When I do mathy animations, for example, I start by thinking about what's actually going on in space and then get the computer to represent things numerically,
举个例子，当我制作这些动画时，我首先考虑空间中究竟发生了什么，然后在计算机上用数字代表这些变化，

thereby figuring out where to place the pixels on the screen.
从而计算出在屏幕上的哪些地方放置像素。

And doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra undestanding.
完成这些工作通常需要依靠对线性代数的深厚理解才能完成。

So there are your vector basics.
以上就是向量的基础内容。

And in the next video I'll start getting into some pretty neat concepts surrounding vectors,
下期视频中，我会开始深入讨论一些围绕向量的非常简明的概念，

like span, bases, and linear dependence.
例如向量张成的空间、基和线性相关。

See you then!
到时候再见！
